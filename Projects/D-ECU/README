This is the D-ECU Subtree inside the iaiaGi project.

The D-ECU is a complex system handling several key functionalities in the iaiaGi conversion architecture.
It stands as a universal development platform to convert internal combustion engine vehicles into EVs.
Acts as a key component for the integration with standard vehicle electronics at multiple levels:
- Vehicle drive control over CAN BUS
- Other subsystems integration for the centralized control (BMS, Controller) 
- Interface twards the pre-existing electronic control units
- Infotainment platform

The complexity of this project requires its decomposition into specific project subtrees.
